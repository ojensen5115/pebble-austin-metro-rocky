Pebble application to display Austin Metro bus arrival time estimates

I decided to learn to write Pebble applications, in order to create an app which will show me when the next few busses are scheduled to arrive at a given stop. This is my first attempt.

Unfortunately, I discovered far too late that rocky.js does not create apps, only watch faces. This means I can't listen to button pushes, so I can't e.g. have the user input what stop ID they're interested in, etc.

Also it doesn't tell the time. So this is a watch face that isn't terribly useful, but it's a barebones example of what I'm trying to do in an app. More to follow in a different repo.
